Dear Philosophical Transactions B,

I am very pleased to send you my manuscript entitled "Evolutionarily stable strategy analysis and its links to demography and genetics through invasion fitness". Given that this manuscript is in an issue honoring 50 years since Maynard Smith and Price's paper, I thought I'd present a review of how the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) concept has matured over those years. Specifically, I review in detail how mathematical theory grounded ESS in the theory of long-term evolution through population genetics. I then connect ESS to invasion fitness, which allows ESSs to be calculated for complex models involving kin and group selection and the evolution of genetic parameters like recombination and mutation. I conclude with some thoughts about how this ability of ESS analysis to incorporate genetics and demography makes ESS a useful tool for the rich genomic and demographic data of the 21st century.

I have included a list of potential reviewers in ManuscriptCentral.

Please let me know if you have any questions about my paper.

Finally, profound thanks for your patience with my submission!

Best wishes,

Jeremy
