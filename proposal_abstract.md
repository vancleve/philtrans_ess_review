Here is again what we would need:
- A tentative title (this should be short and of broad interest)
- The name and affiliation of the lead author
- The paper type (original research, review, opinion piece etc.)
- A brief description of the information to be presented in the article

Our aim is to include a balanced selection of articles, from a wide range of perspectives. One topic we would like to cover is the connection between kin selection and evolutionary game theory. Would you be interested in contributing an article on this topic to the theme issue?

Title: Evolutionary dynamics, equilibrium selection, and what population and quantitative genetics have taught game theory
Paper type: review/research?
Author: Jeremy Van Cleve, University of Kentucky
Abstract:
The application of game theory to animal behavior by Maynard Smith and Price invigorated evolutionary biology by suggesting that the complex dynamics among natural selection, genes, and behavior could be analyzed using an evolutionary refinement of the Nash equilibrium, namely the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). As implied by "equilibrium" and "stable", an ESS is a predicted long-term outcome that an evolutionary process may reach via natural selection and mutation. ESS analysis has been particularly important in highlighting the importance of social dilemmas in biology where the evolution of cooperative behavior can be undermined by the individual fitness costs of that behavior. However, even simple games like the stag-hunt or coordination game can have multiple ESSs, which begs the question, which ESS is more likely to evolve? Unfortunately, ESS analysis does not reveal which ESS is more likely to evolve nor does it even show how genetic or demographic factors affect the speed of approach to an ESS. Progress on determining which ESSs are more "realistic" has been made using tools from stochastic processes and population and quantitative genetics including stochastic stability, absorption times, and G-matrix theory. In this paper, we will review the use of these tools and provide novel insight into how they can predict social evolution as a function of genetic and demographic processes.
